SimpleWindowResizer
===================

Use your cursor to resize windows in OSX!<br />
Stop wasting your valuable energy and time hunting for those darn window edges and corners :)

The main and now only feature is resizing windows to your cursor location, using the hotkey:<code>{ SHIFT, ALT, CMD + X }</code><br />
It has been set to 4 keys because the original hotkey (alt+cmd+x) interfered with other programs.

Simple Window Resizer is a fork from ShiftIt by Aravindkumar Rajendiran, which is no longer under development.
