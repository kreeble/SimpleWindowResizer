SimpleWindowResizer
===================

Use your cursor to resize windows in OSX!<br />
Stop wasting your valuable energy and time hunting for those darn window edges and corners :)

Resize windows to your cursor location with the hotkey:<br /><code>SHIFT, ALT, CMD + X</code><br />

Forked from ShiftIt by Aravindkumar Rajendiran (no longer under development).<br />
Unfortunately, the original code used SVN and the initial import here is lots of untracked code that I'd admittedly have a hard time trusting to use too if I didn't import it myself haha. Use at your own risk.<br />
