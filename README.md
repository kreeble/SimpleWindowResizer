SimpleWindowResizer
===================

Use your cursor to resize windows in OSX! Stop wasting your valuable energy and time hunting for those darn window edges and corners :)

The main and now only feature is resizing windows to your cursor location, using the hotkey: { SHIFT, ALT, CMD + X }

It has been set to 4 keys because the original hotkey { ALT, CMD + X } interfered with other programs.
