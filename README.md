SimpleWindowResizer
===================

Quick and intuitive cursor-based window resizer for OSX! I use it every day.
The main and now only feature is resizing windows to your cursor location, using the hotkey: { SHIFT, ALT, CMD + X }

It has been set to 4 keys because the original hotkey { ALT, CMD + X } interfered with other programs.

Simple Window Resizer is a fork from ShiftIt by Aravindkumar Rajendiran, which is no longer under development.
